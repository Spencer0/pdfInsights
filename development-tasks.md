## Suggested Development Order
1. Start with local dev environment setup
2. Build auth flow end-to-end
3. Create upload component and S3 integration
4. Implement PDF processing with mock LLM
5. Build results display
6. Integrate real LLM
7. Deploy to AWS
8. Add tests and documentation

Each task should take between 2-4 hours for an experienced developer. The entire MVP could be completed in 2-3 weeks of focused work.
